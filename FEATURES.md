### we extracted the following features for the POS/Semantic/Sentiment tagger model

For each comment (i.e. feedback), we distilled features noting if it 1) contains a question, 2) if it consists of a plan, 3-5) if it contains the word “same”, “answer”, and “correct”, and 6-9) if it includes any transitional words or phrases that indicate additive (e.g., “and”,  “further”), adversarial (e.g., “but”, “however”), causal ( e.g., “so”, “thus”), or sequential (e.g., “before”, ”after”) relationships. Additionally, we evaluated the linguistic characteristics of a comment by counting the 10) number of characters, 11) number of words, number of 12) nouns, 13) pronouns, 14) verbs, 15) adjectives, 16) auxiliary words (e.g., “has”, “is”), 17) coordinating conjunction (e.g. “and”, “or”), 18) uses of punctuation, and 19) symbols, which includes mathematical operators (e.g. “$” or “=”). We also counted the number of times 20) first person pronouns are used. Lastly, we included features that reflect the sentiment of a comment by counting the number of 21) positive and 22) negative words used in each comment, using the Bing dictionary (Hu & Liu, 2004).
